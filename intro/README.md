## objectives
* `whoami`
* production-worthy 
* a five line service: start.spring.io:  `devtools`, `web`, `actuator`, `Data JDBC`, `PostgreSQL`,  `docker compose`, `graalvm`, buildpacks. 
	* (remove Docker Compose maven dependency and manually start `compose.yml`; domain is `customer`; add `data.sql`,`schema.sql`; use `RouterFunction<ServerResponse>`; )
	* buildpacks! 
* a simple service that writes SQL DB and reads it from an http endpoint; compile to a native image
* what Spring's good for and not good for
* the history of Spring 
* who's using it
